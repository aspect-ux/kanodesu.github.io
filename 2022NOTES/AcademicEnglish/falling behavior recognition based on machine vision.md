1.[Implementation of Behavior Recognition Based on Machine Vision | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9040773)

#### OVERVIEW

The article mainly concentrates on the detection of human body  to analyze  whether the subject's behavior is normal,which is conducted on video sequence frame and analyzed by algorithms.

##### I. Introduction

1.Detect human body in the surveillance video in real time using  YOLO v3 deep neural network algorithm based on Pytorch framework.

2.Classify the target and capture the tracking of the target;

3.Describe the movements and Judge them;
